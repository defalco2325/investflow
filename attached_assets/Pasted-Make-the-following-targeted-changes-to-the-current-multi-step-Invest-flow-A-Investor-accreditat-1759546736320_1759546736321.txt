Make the following targeted changes to the current multi-step “Invest” flow:

A. Investor accreditation UX

Default to No: Set the “Are you an accredited investor?” state to No on initial render.

Remove copy: Delete the line that says: “Accredited Investors get exclusive access to additional bonus shares.”

Keep the question: Retain the “Are you an accredited investor?” question and Yes/No control.

Inline definition link: Whenever the phrase “Accredited Investor” appears in Step 1, make it a clickable link-styled button (looks like normal text, no underline) that opens a small popover/modal with a short explanation of what an accredited investor is and a “Learn more” link (target="_blank" rel="noopener"). Add proper a11y (role="dialog", focus trap, Esc closes, X button).

B. Step progression / checkout

Bypass Accredited modal on Invest: When the user clicks “Invest Now”, do not show any “Accredited investors” modal. Instead, route directly to the checkout page.

On the checkout page, show a different Step 2 layout/content based on the user’s Step 1 answer (isAccredited: true|false). Use the existing state/store—no new global libs.

C. Consent language & behavior

Pre-checked checkbox: Make the consent checkbox checked by default.

Replace consent text (exact string, preserve punctuation):
“By submitting this form and signing up for communications, you consent to receive marketing email, text & voice messages (e.g. promos, calls, voicemails, cart reminders) from Mode Mobile at the number & email provided. Consent is not a condition of purchase. Msg, voice, & data rates may apply. Msg frequency varies. Unsubscribe at any time by replying STOP or clicking the unsubscribe link (where available). Privacy Policy & Terms.”

Make Privacy Policy a clickable link, but style it like normal text (inherit color, no underline). Keep Terms as is (link if it already was).

D. Lead gating on Step 1

Gate Step 1 with email: Require an email before the user can leave Step 1.

Disable the Continue/Invest actions until a valid email is present.

If the user attempts to navigate away or clicks Invest without an email, surface inline validation and prevent progression.

If you already capture partials, ensure email is captured at blur or on change for drop-offs.

E. Investment tiers

Tier names: Apply the following display names to the existing investment tiers in order (no other changes):

MEMBER

SELECT

ELITE

PREMIER

PRESIDENTIAL

TITANIUM

IMPERIAL

SOVEREIGN

F. Sticky investment summary

Sticky summary: Make the investment summary sticky so it remains visible while scrolling.

Remove the “No. Of Shares” row from this sticky component.

Tighten vertical spacing/line-height so the remaining three lines fit compactly.

Do not include the Investment input/field in the sticky footer (keep inputs only in the main form).

Technical notes (modify existing only)

Reuse current components and styles; add minimal CSS/utility classes as needed.

Preserve existing analytics; if helpful, add data-analytics attributes to the updated controls.

Maintain current routing/state; only extend where necessary to pass isAccredited to checkout Step 2.

Ensure all new links look like normal text (inherit color, no underline) but remain accessible (button for modal trigger; anchor for external links).

Acceptance criteria (must pass before you stop)

On first load of Step 1, accredited = No.

The “exclusive access to additional bonus shares” text is gone.

Clicking “Accredited Investor” opens an explanatory popover/modal with a working external Learn more link; Esc and “X” close it.

Clicking “Invest Now” routes instantly to checkout, with Step 2 content correctly switching based on accredited status.

Consent checkbox is checked by default, and the exact new consent text is displayed. “Privacy Policy” is clickable, styled as normal text.

User cannot proceed or leave Step 1 actions without a valid email; validation message appears.

Tiers display with the exact names listed above.

Sticky summary remains visible while scrolling, shows no “No. Of Shares” row, has tighter line-height, and does not contain the Investment input.

No regressions to existing functionality or styles elsewhere.
